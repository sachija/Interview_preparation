   <h2>what is promises? </h2> 
   <p> callback hell makes our code look haphazard and makes it hard to understand.
    We should always try to avoid using multiple Callbacks to end up falling into callback hell.
    We use Promises to prevent using Callbacks and thereby avoiding Callback Hell.Promises - Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage 
    when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to 
     unmanageable code. It also allows us to make API calls or fetch data from Web Servers successfully. If not 
    able to do so fetches us with an error message.
    It have three stages.
    1. Pending               2. Resolved(fulfilled)          3. Rejected.</p>

    <h2>what is the hoisting ?</h2>
    <p>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
        hoisting is only possible for var and not for const and let
        a variable can be used before it has been declared.</p>

    <h2>what is the purpose of async and await keyword ?</h2>
        <p>The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise.
            The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
     
    <h2>what is DOM ?</h2>
    The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
    The HTML elements as objects
    The properties of all HTML elements
    The methods to access all HTML elements
    The events for all HTML elements

    With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

        </p>
    <h2>what is the difference between undefined,not defined and NaN ?</h2>
        <P> undefined - when we try to access a variable that is declared but not initialized for var keywords.
            null - Its a value that we initialize to a variable which will later be replaced with some other/true value
            not defined - when we try to access a variable that is not declared.</P>

    <H2>what are the operators in javascript</H2>
            <p>
                Arithmetic Operators
                Comparison Operators
                Logical Operators
                Assignment Operators
                Ternary Operators
            </p>
    <h2>what is callback hell</h2>
            <p>Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.</p>
  <h2>what is arrow function</h2>
  <p>Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
     Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:</p>
     let Myfun(a,b)=>a*b;

    <h2>example of async await</h2>
     async function sequentialStart() {
        console.log("==SEQUENTIAL START==");
      
        // 1. Execution gets here almost instantly
        const slow = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
        console.log(slow); // 2. this runs 2 seconds after 1.
      
        const fast = await resolveAfter1Second();
        console.log(fast); // 3. this runs 3 seconds after 1.
      }
